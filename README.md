Bookmark your facebook posts by just clicking 'Faveit' next to it!

Tired of scrolling down the Facebook stream to find interesting posts by your buddies a few days back? 
Here's an ultimate tool to bookmark posts in the Facebook stream without opening the post or even right clicking it.

Just click 'Faveit' and the post's link is automagically added to a separate folder called 'Facebook Favs' in your Google Chrome bookmarks bar.

Feature requests, bugs, feedback are welcome!

Beta version.
